# Multiple Crop Disease Classification
Using SVM Integrated CNN and Inception V3
## Abstract 
“Leaf Disease Classification” is a working “Neural Network” system that involves agricultural crop leaf data and using “Deep Learning Technique”. Agriculture plays a very vital role in every individual life. Without food there exists no life in this world. For that to happen, proper yield of crops is necessary. But these days getting proper yield of crops is a tough task as they are affected with some diseases during their growth and sometimes it remains unnoticed by the farmer and this in turn results in the un-proper yield of crops. To focuses upon detection of such diseases which occur on crops, the concept of “Machine Learning” and “Deep Learning” is being used.  Some common diseases encountered by crops was stored in the database and when the farmer clicks the photo of the leaf of a crop, the model analyses that picture and compares with the database pictures using the concepts of “Artificial Neural Network” and “Deep Neural Network” thus depicts the output whether the crop is affected with a particular or not and thus finally alerts the farmer about the disease. Two different methods are performed for training upon the data sets (train and test data set) to decide which model will provide a better accuracy score. “CNN integrated SVM” and “Inception V3” are used for model building and training purpose. The custom build models are saved for further used in other codes with purpose of saving time and resources. The loss and accuracy graph are being plotted for both the models. The model with higher accuracy is being used for performing actual predictions for image/s provided by the farmer considering the farmer knows what types of crops and its related disease can be predicted by the current model. Thus he/she can take necessary precautions and get a higher yield of crop and hence making more profit.
